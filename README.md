# sampleLinkedInFlask
This script sets up a basic Flask web application that allows users to log in using their LinkedIn accounts through OAuth 2.0, retrieves user data from LinkedIn's API, and restricts access to certain routes to authenticated users only. The core functionalities are user authentication, session management, and access control to different parts of the application.
